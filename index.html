                <li>Christmas Day, December 25th, is a special time where people spend quality time with those close to them to share and spread warmth, joy, and gratitude. However, not everyone is able to do so. The Gift of Gratitude team wants to spread a little holiday cheer to essential personnel who are working on Christmas Day by sharing the gratitude of the Greater Vancouver community through thank you messages and gifts.</li>
                
                <li>The mission of the Gift of Gratitude project is to express our appreciation as a community by distributing mini thank you gifts to essential workers who offer their important services year-round.</li>

                <li>This is our second year working on the Gift of Gratitude project. We are scaling our thank you packages to 1,100 (up from 200 last time!), which will comprise 5-6 mini gifts (such as chocolates, baked goods, tea bags, etc.), and a hand-written thank you card by high school and university students, targeted towards TransLink workers, care home workers, and airport workers. The 1,100 gift packages will be hand-delivered to these essential workers on the morning of Christmas Day.</li>
